## 💡 About Me

I’m a passionate cloud enthusiast with 2+ years of professional experience in **Cloud Tech**. I specialize in designing secure, scalable cloud infrastructures using **AWS** , while optimizing performance through scripting and DevOps tools. Currently pursuing my Master’s at ASU, I enjoy solving real-world problems using cloud-native technologies at the intersection of cloud operations and security.

I'm also actively building a public portfolio of AWS projects — ranging from beginner to advanced — to help others who are getting started in the cloud domain. These hands-on projects cover core services and best practices in cloud architecture.
